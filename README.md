# NZ COVID Tracer

This repository contains documentation that describes the 
[NZ COVID Tracer](https://www.health.govt.nz/nz-covid-tracer) solution. 

NZ COVID Tracer is a Ministry of Health app that allows you to create a digital
diary of places you visit by scanning the official QR codes. This gives contact
tracers a headstart with identifying anyone who may have been exposed to COVID-19
so we can quickly break the chain of transmission.

You can download the app for Android from the 
[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.govt.health.covidtracer) 
and for iOS from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/nz/app/id1511667597).
